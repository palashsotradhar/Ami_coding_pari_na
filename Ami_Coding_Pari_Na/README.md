# This is a django application used for creating a user and make some input for this user.
# On this application I used django-rest-framework for controlling this application from the outside.

In this application, I worked with MVT pattern for doing my work. User can register their instance after registration they are able 
to give input as a number on the input page. After giving their input they can find a number available in their input or not. I also
make an API by using this API outside users can extract data from the website in an inclusive time.
